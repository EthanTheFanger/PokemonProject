			<h1>List of the most iconic pokemons of Pokemon</h1>

			<p>This is a list of the Top 10 most Iconic Pokemon, granted all have been chosen from the Classic generation, but in truth all have been taken into account. The Pokemon that will be remembered for ages to come and won't be forgotten any time soon, if at all. This list isn't based off the most powerful Pokemon, but a combination of popularity, power, and fame that's been spawned from the start.
			</p>

			<p>pokemon has had a huge impact on the world and everybody and their mother know of the series. It's been parodied, copied, and it's gained worldwide attention. The series continues on today, raking in just as much money as ever, and it's all thanks to Nintendo for giving us a much beloved, memorable series that has spawned an anime, manga, movies, and probably more.
